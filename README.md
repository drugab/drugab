Files created for the druggability project.

The file search_druggability.py performs a search on files from the SIDER project (http://sideeffects.embl.de/) to identify synonyms of a given drug and retrieve all side effects reported from all synonyms of each drug, that were reported in SIDER.

The file checkphenotypes.R calculates the number of concordant/discordant phenotypes present in a given Phenoscanner (http://www.phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk) output, which it receives as input. It produces three output files, with the directions of effect per phenotype for each SNP, the count of concordant/discordant phenotypes per SNP and phenotype and the same for a predetermined subset of most important phenotypes.
